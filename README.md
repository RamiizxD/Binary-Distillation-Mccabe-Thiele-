# Binary-Distillation-Mccabe-Thiele-
McCabe–Thiele distillation column design tool implemented in Python using Excel-based VLE data. Computes Nmin, Rmin, and actual number of theoretical stages with full graphical stepping visualization.

Make sure to add your VLE data into an excel sheet that looks exactly like the example to avoid any errors :)
